Stages in SDLC

Requrierements Gathering ==> Design(low and high level) ==> Coding ==> Testing ==> Deploy(release )==> maintanince

==============================
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SDLC MODEL
==============================
1)waterfall model
2)prototype
3)v model
4)rad model
5)Sprial model
6)Agile model


==========
AGILE
1)The methodology which follows iterative and incremental approach
================
Agile Principles
================
1)Customer no need to wait for longtime
2)We develop and test and release as a piece of s/w to customer with few number of features
3)we can accept/accomodate the requriement changes
4)good communication between business analyst,tester,developer and customer

====
ex
===
1)100 requriements 
   ==>in spring 1 10 requriemtns done and like wayy

====================
Advantages of AGILE
=====================
1)requirement changes are allowed or accomodated in any stage of development
2)Release will be very fast (Weekly 1-4)
3)Good communication is maintained between team

=====================
Disadvantages
=====================
1)Less Design and documentation
======
SCRUM
=======
Scrum is a framework though which we build software products by following agile principles
In scum it includes group of people called as scrum team which contains 4-8 people
1)Product owner
2)Scrum master
3)Dev Team
4)QA Team

==============
SCRUM TERMINOGIES
===================
1)User Story



==========
User Story  ==> A feature or module of a software
===========
Epic  ==> collection of user stories is called as Epic
===========
Product Backlog ==> Contains list of user stories, decided by product owner 
============
Sprint==> Period of time to complete user stories, decided by product owner and team 
(2-4) weeks

Sprint Planning Meeting ==>Meeting conducted with a team to define what can be delivered in the sprint
and duration of the sprint
=================
Spring Backlog ==>List of committed stories by DEV/QA for specific sprints

Scrum Meeting ==> Meeting conducted by scrum master everyday 12 min and also called as 
Standup call/meetin/scrum call ) (yesterday,todays stories adn issures , blockers will be disscussed)
=================
(scrum master) (product owner)
Sprint Retrospective Meeting==>Conduects meeting after every sprint.The entire team which
inclues both scrum master and product owner will participate
==================
Story point==> Rough estimation of user stories will be given by Dev and QA
===================
